ravshello
=========

Do you have an account with ravellosystems.com?

Do you want to use the command-line to manage your account?

**Check this out.**

Haven't set it up to be a proper python package yet, so here's some simple get-started instructions:

```
git clone https://github.com/ryran/ravshello.git ~/ravshello
mkdir ~/bin
ln -sv ~/ravshello/ravshello.py ~/bin/ravshello
ln -sv ~/ravshello/rav-notify.py ~/bin/rav-notify
wget -P ~/ravshello https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryran/python-sdk/experimental/lib/ravello_sdk.py
yum install python-configshell
ravshello
```

After that, you could optionally populate the config file to avoid typing user/pass all the time:

```
cp -v ~/ravshello/config.yaml ~/.ravshello/
vim ~/.ravshello/config.yaml
```

You could also optionally run `rav-notify` to get GUI notifications for your apps.

Forgive the lack of words. For the moment I'll just let these screenshots speak for themselves.
